This project is designed to analyze Instagram follower data. It compares the list of users you follow with those who follow you back and those who don't. The results are presented in an interactive HTML page where you can view users who don't follow you back, users you don't follow back, and mutual follows.

Usage Instructions:
Download Instagram Follower Data:

Download your follower data from Instagram in JSON format.
Save the downloaded JSON file into the same directory as instagramAnalysis.py.
Running the Script:

Run instagramAnalysis.py in your Python environment.
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required packages (json, datetime, and possibly requests if fetching data).
The script will generate an follow_analysis.html file in the same directory.
Viewing Results:

Open follow_analysis.html in a web browser to view the analysis results.
Use the navigation bar to switch between different sections showing users who don't follow you back, users you don't follow back, and mutual follows.
